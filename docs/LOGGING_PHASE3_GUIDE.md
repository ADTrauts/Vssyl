---

## üöÄ Deployment & Setup

### Step 1: Deploy Code
```bash
# Already committed and ready to push
git push origin main

# Wait for Cloud Build (~7-10 minutes)
# Monitor at: Cloud Console ‚Üí Cloud Build
```

### Step 2: Initialize Policies & Alerts
Once deployed, run the initialization script:

```bash
# SSH into your Cloud Run instance or run locally with production DB connection
cd server
npm run build
node dist/scripts/initialize-logging-policies.js
```

**What this creates:**
- 1 retention policy with defaults (30/90/365 days)
- 5 critical alert configurations:
  1. High Error Rate Alert (>10 errors in 5 min)
  2. Critical Security Events (immediate)
  3. Authentication Failures (>5 failed attempts)
  4. Database Connection Issues (>3 failures)
  5. Slow API Response Times (>5 sec, disabled by default)

### Step 3: Configure Email Alerts
1. Navigate to `/admin-portal/system-logs`
2. Click "Alerts" tab
3. Update email addresses for each alert
4. Enable/disable alerts as needed

- Recommended: **ON** for production

#### System Enable/Disable

## üîî Alert Configuration Details

### Pre-configured Alerts:

#### 1. High Error Rate Alert
```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "level": ["error"],
    "threshold": 10,
    "timeWindow": 300
  },
  "actions": {
    "email": ["admin@vssyl.com"],
    "threshold": 10
  }
}
```
**Triggers**: When 10+ errors occur within 5 minutes  
**Use**: Detect system-wide issues

#### 2. Critical Security Events
```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "level": ["error"],
    "operation": ["security_event"],
    "message": "critical"
  },
  "actions": {
    "email": ["security@vssyl.com"],
    "threshold": 1
  }
}
```
**Triggers**: Immediately on any critical security event  
**Use**: Security incident response

#### 3. Authentication Failures
```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "level": ["warn", "error"],
    "operation": ["user_login", "security_event"],
    "message": "login_failed"
  },
  "actions": {
    "email": ["security@vssyl.com"],
    "threshold": 5
  }
}
```
**Triggers**: After 5 failed login attempts  
**Use**: Detect brute force attacks

#### 4. Database Connection Issues
```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "level": ["error"],
    "message": "database"
  },
  "actions": {
    "email": ["ops@vssyl.com"],
    "threshold": 3
  }
}
```
**Triggers**: After 3 database connection failures  
**Use**: Infrastructure monitoring

#### 5. Slow API Response Times
```json
{
  "conditions": {
    "level": ["warn"],
    "operation": ["api_request"]
  },
  "actions": {
    "email": ["ops@vssyl.com"],

## üß™ Testing

### Test Retention Settings
1. Navigate to Settings tab
2. Change retention periods
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Verify success message appears
5. Refresh page - settings should persist

### Test Alerts
1. Navigate to Alerts tab
2. Toggle an alert (enable/disable)
3. Verify badge changes color
4. Try deleting a test alert (‚ö†Ô∏è can't undo)

### Test Alert Triggering
**Option 1: Natural Triggers**
- Wait for errors to occur naturally
- Check configured email addresses for notifications

**Option 2: Manual Testing** (Advanced)
```typescript
// In a test endpoint or script
await logger.error('Test error for alert triggering', {
  operation: 'test_alert'
});
```

### Test Auto-Cleanup
**Note**: Cleanup runs daily. To test immediately:

1. Set retention to 1 day
2. Create test logs older than 1 day (manually in DB)
3. Wait 24 hours or manually trigger cleanup:

```bash
# Run cleanup script
cd server
node dist/scripts/cleanup-old-logs.js
```

## üéì Best Practices

### Retention Periods
- **Development**: 7-30 days (conserve storage)
- **Staging**: 30-60 days (recent debugging)
- **Production**: 30/90/365 days (compliance & debugging)
- **Highly Regulated**: 365+ days for audit logs

### Alert Thresholds
- **Too Low**: Alert fatigue (too many notifications)
- **Too High**: Miss critical issues
- **Recommended**: Start conservative, adjust based on noise

### Email Configuration
- Use distribution lists (security@, ops@, admin@)
- Don't use personal emails (people change roles)
- Test email delivery before enabling alerts

### Auto-Cleanup
- **Always enable** in production (prevents DB bloat)
- Disable only for:
  - Active investigations
  - Compliance holds
  - Legal proceedings

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Alerts Not Triggering
**Check:**
1. Alert is enabled (green badge)
2. Threshold is set appropriately
3. Email addresses are valid
4. Logs matching conditions exist
5. Check server logs for alert processing errors

### Retention Not Working
**Check:**
1. Auto-cleanup is enabled
2. Retention system is enabled
3. Check lastCleanup timestamp in database
4. Verify cleanup job is running (check server logs)

### Settings Not Saving
**Check:**
1. Admin role permission
2. Network connectivity
3. Backend API is responding
4. Browser console for errors
