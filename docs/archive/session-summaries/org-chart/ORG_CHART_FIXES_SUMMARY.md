# 🔧 Org Chart Testing - Quick Summary

## ✅ **TESTING COMPLETE - 2 CRITICAL BUGS FIXED**

### **🐛 Bug #1: Permission Filtering Broken** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Widget visibility by role/position/tier/department would not work  
**Cause**: Code was looking for `userId` on `Position` model, but positions link to users via `EmployeePosition` table  
**Fix**: Created proper `getUserPositions()` method that queries the junction table  
**Files**: `server/src/services/businessFrontPageService.ts`

### **🐛 Bug #2: Announcements Using Mock Data** (MODERATE)
**Problem**: Announcements widget showed hardcoded data, not admin-configured announcements  
**Cause**: TODO comment, not implemented  
**Fix**: Now fetches from API, filters expired announcements automatically  
**Files**: `web/src/components/business/widgets/AnnouncementsWidget.tsx`
