## 📊 **OVERVIEW**

The Org Chart system is a **comprehensive, enterprise-grade organizational management platform** that handles:
- Organizational structure (tiers, departments, positions)
- Permission management (role-based access control)
- Employee assignment and management
- Visual org chart building
- Audit trails for all changes

## ✅ **WHAT EXISTS & IS WORKING**

### **🗄️ Database Schema (Prisma Models)**

All models exist and are properly defined:

- Actual visual rendering of org chart (tree view, hierarchy view)
- Drag-and-drop reorganization
- Export org chart as image/PDF

**Current State:**
- Builder component exists (736 lines)
- Likely has basic visualization

**Action Needed:**

- Check mobile responsiveness

---

### **6. Reports & Analytics** ⚠️
**What's Missing:**
- Permission audit reports
- Employee distribution reports
- Department headcount analytics
