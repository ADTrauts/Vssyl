# Admin Portal Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to testing each page of the admin portal to verify functionality vs mock data.

## Test Categories

### 1. **Fully Functional Pages** (Real API + Real Data)
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard** - Real stats from database
- ‚úÖ **User Management** - Real user data with impersonation
- ‚úÖ **Modules** - Real module submissions and stats
- ‚úÖ **Support** - Real tickets and knowledge base
- ‚úÖ **Performance** - Real system metrics
- ‚úÖ **Business Intelligence** - Real analytics data

### 2. **Partially Functional Pages** (Real API + Mock Data)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Analytics** - API exists but may use mock data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Billing** - API exists but uses mock data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security** - API exists but may use mock data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **System** - API exists but may use mock data

### 3. **Test/Development Pages**
- üîß **Test Impersonation** - Development/testing
- üîß **Test Auth** - Development/testing
- üîß **Debug Session** - Development/testing
- üîß **Test API** - Development/testing

## API Endpoint Verification

### Real Database Queries
- `/dashboard/stats` - Real user/business counts
- `/users` - Real user data with counts
- `/modules/submissions` - Real module data
- `/support/tickets` - Real support data
- `/performance/metrics` - Real system metrics

### Mock Data Endpoints

- `/analytics` - May use mock data
- `/security/events` - May use mock data

## Testing Steps

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Login as Admin**
   - Navigate to admin portal
   - Verify admin authentication

3. **Test Each Page**
   - Load page
   - Check for errors in console
   - Verify data is real vs mock
   - Test interactive features
   - Check API calls in network tab

4. **Document Issues**
   - Note which pages use mock data
   - Identify broken functionality
   - List missing features
