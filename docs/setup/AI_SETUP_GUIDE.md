# ü§ñ Digital Life Twin AI - Setup Guide

## üéØ **What You've Built**

You now have the **world's first Digital Life Twin AI system** - an AI that doesn't just respond to queries, but actually understands and operates as your digital representation across your entire life ecosystem.

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **1. Environment Setup**

Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory with:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/blockondrive"

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-here"

# AI Provider Keys (REQUIRED)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-api-key-here"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-anthropic-api-key-here"

# Application
NODE_ENV="development"
PORT=5000
```

### **2. Start the System**

```bash
# From project root
pnpm dev
```

This starts:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000
- **AI Services**: Ready for requests

### **3. First-Time Setup**

1. **Sign up/Login** to your account
2. **Navigate to any dashboard** - the AI-enhanced search bar is now active
3. **Visit `/ai`** - Complete the personality questionnaire (takes 5-10 minutes)
4. **Start using AI** - Try both searching and asking questions in the search bar

## üåü **Revolutionary Features**

### **AI-Enhanced Search Bar**
- **Smart Intent Detection**: Automatically detects if you're searching vs asking AI
