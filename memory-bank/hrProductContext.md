# HR Module Product Context

**Last Updated**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION DEPLOYED - Framework Complete, Features Pending  
**Module ID**: `hr`  
**Category**: Business Only  
**Minimum Tier**: Business Advanced
**Production URL**: `/business/[id]/admin/hr` (Admin), `/business/[id]/workspace?module=hr` (Workspace), `/business/[id]/workspace/hr/me` (Employee)

---

## 🎯 Overview

The HR Management module provides comprehensive human resources functionality for businesses, extending the existing org chart system with employee lifecycle management, attendance tracking, payroll processing, and more.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Framework First**: Build structure before features
2. **Extends Org Chart**: Leverages existing organizational structure
3. **Tiered Features**: Business Advanced (limited) vs Enterprise (full)
4. **Three Access Levels**: Admin, Manager, Employee
5. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All data scoped by businessId

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Three-Tier Access Structure

```
HR Module Access
├── Admin (Business Owners/Admins)
│   └── /business/[id]/admin/hr
│       ├── Full employee directory
│       ├── Company-wide reports
│       ├── HR settings
│       └── All HR features
│
├── Manager (Employees with Direct Reports)
│   └── /business/[id]/workspace/hr/team
│       ├── Team member view
│       ├── Team time-off approvals
│       ├── Team attendance
│       └── Team reports
│
└── Employee (All Business Members)
    └── /business/[id]/workspace/hr/me
        ├── Own profile view
        ├── Time-off requests
        ├── Pay stubs view
        └── Benefits view
```

### Manager Approval Hierarchy

**Key Requirement**: Managers cannot approve their own requests. Time-off and other approvals automatically route to the next level up in the org chart.

**Example**:
```
Employee requests time off → Manager approves
Manager requests time off → Director approves (skip level)
Director requests time off → VP approves
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Models

#### EmployeeHRProfile
Extends org chart EmployeePosition with HR-specific data:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  employeePositionId: string;  // Links to org chart
  businessId: string;          // Multi-tenant isolation
  hireDate?: Date;
  terminationDate?: Date;
  employeeType?: 'FULL_TIME' | 'PART_TIME' | 'CONTRACT' | 'INTERN';
  workLocation?: string;
  emergencyContact?: JSON;
  personalInfo?: JSON;
  deletedAt?: Date;  // Soft delete for compliance
}
```

#### ManagerApprovalHierarchy
Defines who approves what for each employee:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  employeePositionId: string;  // Employee needing approval
  managerPositionId: string;   // Manager providing approval
  businessId: string;
  approvalTypes: string[];     // ['time-off', 'expenses', etc.]
  approvalLevel: number;       // 1 = direct, 2 = skip-level
  isPrimary: boolean;
  active: boolean;
}
```

#### HRModuleSettings
Business-level HR configuration:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  businessId: string;
  timeOffSettings?: JSON;      // PTO policies, accrual rules
  workWeekSettings?: JSON;     // Days/hours, start day
  payrollSettings?: JSON;      // Pay period, direct deposit
  enabledFeatures?: JSON;      // Feature toggles
}
```

## 🛡️ Permission System

### Permission Hierarchy

```
hr:admin                    // Full HR access
  ├── hr:employees:read     // View all employees
  ├── hr:employees:write    // Manage employees
  ├── hr:settings:manage    // Configure HR
  └── hr:*:*                // All HR permissions

hr:team:view                // Manager access
  ├── hr:team:approve       // Approve team requests
  └── hr:team:reports       // Team reports

hr:self:view                // Employee access (everyone)
  ├── hr:self:update        // Update own data
  └── hr:self:request       // Request time off
```

### Permission Checks

All HR endpoints check:
1. **Authentication**: User must be logged in
2. **Business Membership**: User must be member of business
3. **Tier Access**: Business Advanced or Enterprise tier
4. **Module Installation**: HR module must be installed
5. **Role Permission**: Admin/Manager/Employee access level
6. **Feature Gate**: Specific feature available on tier

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Org Chart Integration

**Data Flow**:
```
User Account
    ↓
Business Membership
    ↓
Org Chart Position (EmployeePosition) ← Org chart system
    ↓
HR Profile (EmployeeHRProfile) ← HR module extends this
    ↓
Feature Data (Attendance, Payroll, etc.) ← Future features
```

**Key Relationships**:
- `EmployeeHRProfile.employeePositionId → EmployeePosition.id`
- `ManagerApprovalHierarchy` references `EmployeePosition` (not User)
- Permissions inherited from org chart positions

### Business Workspace Integration

**Admin Access**:
- HR admin features in Business Admin Dashboard
- Located at `/business/[id]/admin/hr`
- Accessible from admin sidebar navigation

**Employee/Manager Access**:
- Self-service and team features render inside the unified workspace
- Primary entry: `/business/[id]/workspace?module=hr` (unified renderer)
- Deep links remain at `/business/[id]/workspace/hr/*` for specific views
- Accessible from Work tab and sidebar; module list provided by BusinessConfigurationContext

---

## 🤖 AI Integration

### AI Context Registered

**Keywords**: hr, employee, staff, attendance, payroll, performance, etc.  
**Patterns**: "how many employees", "who is off today", "payroll report"  
**Concepts**: employee lifecycle, workforce administration  

### Context Providers

```typescript
GET /api/hr/ai/context/overview
// Returns: Employee count, active modules, tier info

GET /api/hr/ai/context/headcount
// Returns: Employee counts by department/position

GET /api/hr/ai/context/time-off
// Returns: Who's off today/this week
```

**Cache Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Response Time Target**: < 500ms

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

**CRITICAL**: All HR queries MUST include businessId

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - Data isolation
const employees = await prisma.employeeHRProfile.findMany({
  where: {
    businessId: businessId,
    deletedAt: null
  }
});

// ❌ Wrong - Data leakage vulnerability!
const employees = await prisma.employeeHRProfile.findMany({
  where: { deletedAt: null }
});
```

### Permission Check Pattern

```typescript
// Every HR endpoint follows this pattern:
1. Authenticate user (authenticateJWT)
2. Check tier access (checkBusinessAdvancedOrHigher)
3. Check module installed (checkHRModuleInstalled)
4. Check role permission (checkHRAdmin/checkManagerAccess/checkEmployeeAccess)
5. Check feature gate (checkHRFeature for enterprise features)
6. Execute business logic
```

### Feature Gating Pattern

```typescript
// Backend feature gate
router.get('/admin/payroll',
  checkHRFeature('payroll'),  // Enterprise only
  checkHRAdmin,
  payrollController
);

// Frontend feature display
const hrFeatures = useHRFeatures(businessTier);
if (hrFeatures.payroll) {
  // Show payroll feature
} else {
  // Show upgrade prompt
}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security Considerations

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Every query MUST include `businessId`
2. **Soft Deletes**: HR data retained for compliance (use `deletedAt`)
3. **Sensitive Data**: Personal info and payroll encrypted in production
4. **Access Control**: Three-tier permission system strictly enforced

### Manager Approval Rules

1. **Cannot Self-Approve**: Managers' requests go to their manager
2. **Hierarchy-Based**: Uses org chart reporting structure
3. **Escalation Support**: Can escalate if primary manager unavailable
4. **Approval Types**: Different approvers for different request types

### Tier Limitations

**Business Advanced**:
- Employee limit: 50 employees
- No payroll features
- No recruitment features
- No performance reviews
- No benefits admin
- Basic attendance only

**Upgrade Path**:
- Clear upgrade prompts in UI
- Feature-specific upgrade messages
- Direct link to billing/upgrade page
