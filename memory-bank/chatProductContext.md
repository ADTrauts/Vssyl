# Chat Product Context

## 1. Header & Purpose
- **Purpose**: The chat application serves as a comprehensive communication and collaboration platform that caters to both enterprise organizations and individual users. It provides structured communication through various thread types, organized workspaces, and intuitive navigation.
- **Cross-References**: 
  - [Drive Product Context](./driveProductContext.md) (file sharing)
  - [Dashboard Product Context](./dashboardProductContext.md) (activity widgets)
  - [Marketplace Product Context](./marketplaceProductContext.md) (bots/plugins)
  - [System Patterns](./systemPatterns.md)
  - [API Documentation](./apiDocumentation.md)

## 2. Problem Space
- **Primary Users:**
  - Enterprise admin
  - Team member
  - Guest/external collaborator
  - Individual user (lifestyle/personal)
- **Enterprise Needs:**
  - Structured communication, decision making, documentation
- **Individual Needs:**
  - Personal organization, direct/group communication, file sharing

## 3. User Experience Goals
- Intuitive, panel-based navigation
- Context preservation and quick access
- Clear organizational hierarchy and resource discovery
- Rich, structured threading (message, topic, project, decision, documentation)
- Real-time collaboration and feedback
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast
- Internationalization: Support for multiple languages and locale formats
- **Persistent Floating Chat Icon/Popup:** Chat must be accessible from anywhere in the app via a floating icon or minimized chat window, inspired by Facebook/LinkedIn (see also dashboardProductContext.md).

## 3a. Panel-Based Layout & Navigation

The Chat module uses a panel-based interface for intuitive, efficient navigation and multitasking. The layout is structured as follows:

- **Left Panel:** Conversation/Thread List
  - Shows all conversations, threads, or channels the user is part of
  - Allows quick switching between conversations
- **Main Panel:** Active Conversation/Thread
  - Displays messages, file previews, reactions, and thread replies
  - Supports inline editing, replying, and file sharing
- **Side Panels (optional):**
  - Thread details, participants, or message actions
  - Can be used for thread-specific analytics, pinned messages, or context
- **Panel Features:**
  - Panels are resizable and collapsible
  - State is preserved when switching between panels
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- **Floating Chat Icon/Popup (Global):**
  - A floating chat icon or minimized chat window is always visible throughout the app, regardless of the current module or page.
  - Clicking the icon expands the chat window, allowing users to continue conversations without leaving their current context.
  - The floating chat UI should be non-intrusive, responsive, and accessible on both desktop and mobile.
  - This pattern is inspired by Facebook/LinkedIn and is a core part of the platform's persistent communication vision (see dashboardProductContext.md).

This structure enables users to manage multiple conversations, threads, and resources efficiently, and is a core UX principle for the Chat module.

## 4. Core Features & Requirements
- Organized workspaces and teams
- Threaded conversations (message, topic, project, decision, documentation)
- Real-time messaging and presence
- File sharing and preview (see File Management & Sharing)
- Reactions and emoji support
- Search and resource discovery
- Role-based access and permissions
- Notifications and activity tracking
- Collaborative editing and versioning
- API access and plugin/bot support
- **Floating Chat Icon/Popup:** Always-available chat access via a floating icon or minimized window, integrated globally across the app.
