# Chat Product Context

## 1. Header & Purpose
- **Purpose**: The chat application serves as a comprehensive communication and collaboration platform that caters to both enterprise organizations and individual users. It provides structured communication through various thread types, organized workspaces, and intuitive navigation.
- **Cross-References**: 
  - [Drive Product Context](./driveProductContext.md) (file sharing)
  - [Dashboard Product Context](./dashboardProductContext.md) (activity widgets)
  - [Marketplace Product Context](./marketplaceProductContext.md) (bots/plugins)
  - [System Patterns](./systemPatterns.md)
  - [API Documentation](./apiDocumentation.md)

## 2. Problem Space
- **Primary Users:**
  - Enterprise admin
  - Team member
  - Guest/external collaborator
  - Individual user (lifestyle/personal)
- **Enterprise Needs:**
  - Structured communication, decision making, documentation
- **Individual Needs:**
  - Personal organization, direct/group communication, file sharing

## 3. User Experience Goals
- Intuitive, panel-based navigation
- Context preservation and quick access
- Clear organizational hierarchy and resource discovery
- Rich, structured threading (message, topic, project, decision, documentation)
- Real-time collaboration and feedback
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast
- Internationalization: Support for multiple languages and locale formats
- **Persistent Floating Chat Icon/Popup:** Chat must be accessible from anywhere in the app via a floating icon or minimized chat window, inspired by Facebook/LinkedIn (see also dashboardProductContext.md).

## 3a. Panel-Based Layout & Navigation

The Chat module uses a panel-based interface for intuitive, efficient navigation and multitasking. The layout is structured as follows:

- **Left Panel:** Conversation/Thread List
  - Shows all conversations, threads, or channels the user is part of
  - Allows quick switching between conversations
- **Main Panel:** Active Conversation/Thread
  - Displays messages, file previews, reactions, and thread replies
  - Supports inline editing, replying, and file sharing
- **Side Panels (optional):**
  - Thread details, participants, or message actions
  - Can be used for thread-specific analytics, pinned messages, or context
- **Panel Features:**
  - Panels are resizable and collapsible
  - State is preserved when switching between panels
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- **Floating Chat Icon/Popup (Global):**
  - A floating chat icon or minimized chat window is always visible throughout the app, regardless of the current module or page.
  - Clicking the icon expands the chat window, allowing users to continue conversations without leaving their current context.
  - The floating chat UI should be non-intrusive, responsive, and accessible on both desktop and mobile.
  - This pattern is inspired by Facebook/LinkedIn and is a core part of the platform's persistent communication vision (see dashboardProductContext.md).
  - **Dashboard Tabs (January 2025)**: The floating chat includes dashboard tabs at the top to quickly switch between personal and business/enterprise chat contexts. Personal dashboards appear first, followed by business dashboards. Each tab shows unread message counts and enterprise indicators (shield icons) for business dashboards. Tabs are horizontally scrollable for many dashboards. Chat is treated as a core module that's always available on all dashboards (no widget installation required).

This structure enables users to manage multiple conversations, threads, and resources efficiently, and is a core UX principle for the Chat module.

## 4. Core Features & Requirements
- Organized workspaces and teams
- Threaded conversations (message, topic, project, decision, documentation)
- Real-time messaging and presence
- File sharing and preview (see File Management & Sharing)
- Reactions and emoji support
- Search and resource discovery
- Role-based access and permissions
- Notifications and activity tracking
- Collaborative editing and versioning
- API access and plugin/bot support
- **Floating Chat Icon/Popup:** Always-available chat access via a floating icon or minimized window, integrated globally across the app.
