# Admin Product Context

**Description:**
This file documents the product context for all admin-facing features, including user/org management, system settings, and monitoring.

## 1. Header & Purpose
- **Purpose:**  
  The Admin Portal provides a comprehensive "God Mode" interface for platform administrators to manage users, organizations, system settings, and monitor platform activity. It centralizes administrative controls for security, compliance, and operational oversight with a dedicated admin portal at `/admin-portal`.
- **Cross-References:**  
  - [developerProductContext.md] (developer tools, monitoring)
  - [systemPatterns.md] (admin patterns, access control)
  - [databaseContext.md] (user/org models, audit logs)

## 2. Problem Space
- Need for centralized management of users, organizations, and permissions.
- Requirement for oversight of sharing, access, and platform activity.
- Admins must be able to audit, intervene, and maintain compliance.
- Need for secure user impersonation for debugging and support.
- Comprehensive audit logging and security monitoring.

## 3. User Experience Goals
- Clear, intuitive dashboards for managing users, shares, and activity.
- Fast access to critical admin actions (role changes, share removal, take over).
- Real-time feedback and error handling.
- Secure, role-based access to admin features.
- Professional admin interface similar to enterprise SaaS platforms.

## 3a. Admin Portal Layout & Navigation
- **Dedicated Admin Portal**: Separate `/admin-portal` route with enhanced security
- **Left Sidebar**: Navigation between admin sections (Dashboard, Users, Moderation, Analytics, Billing, Security, System)
- **Main Panel**: Data tables for users, content, and activity logs with filtering and actions
- **Header**: System status, admin user info, and quick actions
