## UI Component Audit (2024-06)

### Gaps Identified
- Potential duplication (e.g., Avatar in both common and ui)
- Missing common UI elements: Table/DataGrid, Pagination, Breadcrumbs, Advanced Modal/Drawer, File Picker/Upload, Empty State, Loading Skeleton
- Inconsistent usage of shared UI primitives
- Layout/navigation patterns not fully abstracted

### Recommendations
1. Consolidate duplicates into a single shared directory
2. Expand the core UI library with missing primitives
3. Enforce usage guidelines and document best practices
4. Abstract layout/navigation components for all modules
5. Audit and refactor modules to use shared components
6. Document all shared UI components and (optionally) set up Storybook

### Next Steps
- Prioritize consolidation and expansion of the shared UI library
- Begin with the most commonly duplicated or missing elements
- Document and communicate best practices to the team

## Analytics Module Interoperability (2024-06)

### Findings
- The `useAnalytics` hook provides a shared interface for retrieving analytics data (thread, user, tag, trending threads) and exporting analytics, accessible to any module.
- REST API endpoints (`/api/analytics/...`) make analytics data available platform-wide.
- Analytics components are modular and domain-focused (e.g., ComplianceAnalytics, RiskAnalytics).
- Backend services (AnalyticsService, ThreadAnalyticsService, AnalyticsCoordinator) centralize analytics logic and aggregation.
- Real-time analytics is designed (via `useAnalyticsWebSocket`), but implementation and cross-module usage may be incomplete.

### Strengths
- Shared analytics API/hook enables consistent data access across modules.
- Modular analytics components allow for easy extension and integration.
- Backend services support analytics features platform-wide.

### Gaps
- No clear evidence of analytics data being actively pushed into other modules for context-aware features.
- Real-time analytics integration is not fully implemented or leveraged across modules.
- No event bus or pub/sub pattern for analytics events detected on the frontend.

### Recommendations
1. Promote use of the shared `useAnalytics` hook in all modules.
2. Implement and document real-time analytics integration (e.g., `useAnalyticsWebSocket`).
3. Enable cross-module analytics insights (e.g., show thread analytics in chat, file analytics in drive).
4. Consider a frontend event bus for analytics events.

### Next Steps
- Document usage patterns and provide examples for common analytics use cases.
- Ensure real-time analytics is available and documented for all modules.
- Identify and implement opportunities for contextual analytics in other modules.
