## Overview

This document contains comprehensive brainstorming for 150+ module ideas across three categories:

- **üè¢ Business-Only Modules**: Enterprise/work-specific functionality
- **üë§ Personal-Only Modules**: Individual/lifestyle-specific functionality
- **üîÑ Dual-Context Modules**: Modules that adapt based on personal vs. business context

### Key Principles

1. **Context-Aware Design**: Modules should intelligently adapt to personal vs. business contexts
2. **Org Chart Integration**: Business modules leverage existing organizational structure
3. **AI Enhancement**: Every module benefits from Vssyl's AI capabilities
4. **Permission System**: Role-based access using existing permission infrastructure
5. **Marketplace Ready**: Modules designed for both first-party and third-party development

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Module Development Requirements

### **MANDATORY: Every Module MUST Have AI Context Integration**

All modules (built-in and third-party) **MUST** implement AI Context integration to connect with Vssyl's AI system. This is non-negotiable for platform consistency.

#### Required AI Context Components

Every module must define:

1. **Purpose**: Clear one-sentence description
2. **Category**: productivity | communication | business | household | health | entertainment | utilities
3. **Keywords**: 10-20 keywords users might say (e.g., "task", "to-do", "project", "deadline")
4. **Patterns**: 5-10 natural language patterns (e.g., "show my tasks", "what's due today")
5. **Concepts**: Core concepts the module handles (e.g., "task management", "deadlines", "priorities")
6. **Entities**: What the module manages (e.g., "task", "project", "milestone")
7. **Actions**: What users can do (e.g., "create-task", "complete-task", "assign-task")
8. **Context Providers**: API endpoints that return live data for AI queries

#### Context Provider Requirements

- **Authentication**: All endpoints MUST use `authenticateJWT` middleware
- **Response Time**: < 500ms recommended
- **Data Limit**: Return 10-20 recent/relevant items only
- **Cache Duration**: 5-15 minutes for dynamic data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses

#### Registration

Modules must register their AI context on installation:
```typescript
POST /api/modules/:moduleId/ai/context
Body: ModuleAIContext object
```

**See**: `docs/MODULE_AI_CONTEXT_GUIDE.md` for complete implementation guide

## üìä Completion Status Legend

Each module idea includes a completion status to track development progress:

| Status | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Planning** | üìã | Idea documented, requirements being gathered |
| **Design** | üé® | UI/UX design and technical architecture in progress |
| **In Development** | üöß | Actively being built |
| **Testing** | üß™ | Feature complete, undergoing testing |
| **Beta** | üî¨ | Available for beta testing |
| **Completed** | ‚úÖ | Production-ready and deployed |

## üí° Key Strategic Insights

**Strategy**: Establish platform first, then verticalize

### 5. AI Integration Everywhere
**Every module benefits from AI**:

- Expense: Auto-categorization
- Time Tracking: Smart suggestions
- HR: Performance insights

**Strategy**: Build AI capabilities into core platform, expose to all modules
