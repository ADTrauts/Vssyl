# Contributor Guide

## Onboarding
- Read the entire Memory Bank, starting with [README.md](./README.md), to understand project rules, structure, and context.
- Set up your local environment using the instructions in the project README and `.env.example` files.
- Familiarize yourself with the project structure (see [techContext.md](./techContext.md)).
- Review the [lintingAndCodeQuality.md](./lintingAndCodeQuality.md) and [testingStrategy.md](./testingStrategy.md) files for code quality and testing requirements.
- For module-specific work, read the relevant product context and specs (e.g., [chatProductContext.md](./chatProductContext.md), [moduleSpecs.md](./moduleSpecs.md)).
- Ask for a walkthrough or code review if you are unsure about any part of the process.

## Memory Bank Usage
- Every contributor is responsible for keeping the Memory Bank up to date.
- Before making major changes, check for relevant update rules at the top of each file.
- Use cross-references instead of duplicating content between files.
- Archive outdated sections rather than deleting them.
- Summarize significant changes at the top of the file.
- When in doubt, ask for review before updating Memory Bank files.

## Best Practices
- Follow the code style and linting rules in [lintingAndCodeQuality.md](./lintingAndCodeQuality.md).
- Write and maintain tests as described in [testingStrategy.md](./testingStrategy.md).
- Document all new modules, features, and patterns in the appropriate Memory Bank files.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages and PR descriptions.
- Collaborate respectfully and review others' work constructively.
- Keep all documentation, onboarding, and best practices up to date as the project evolves.
