Update Rules for testingStrategy.md
- Updated when testing philosophy, coverage requirements, or QA workflow change.
- All changes should be dated and well-documented.
- Use cross-references to other memory bank files for related patterns or requirements.
- Archive outdated sections rather than deleting.
- Add a table of contents if file exceeds 200 lines.
- Summarize changes at the top if the update is significant.

# Testing & QA Strategy

## Philosophy
- Testing is essential for reliability, maintainability, and rapid iteration.
- All critical business logic, core modules, and shared utilities must be covered by automated tests.
- Tests should be fast, deterministic, and easy to maintain.
- Testing is a shared responsibilityâ€”every contributor is expected to write and maintain tests for their code.

## Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests:**
  - All core business logic, utility functions, and module logic must have unit tests.
  - Target: 80%+ coverage for core modules and shared utilities.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Key module interactions, API endpoints, and database operations must be covered by integration tests.
  - Target: All critical user flows and API endpoints.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - Major user journeys (e.g., login, file upload, chat, module install) must be covered by E2E tests.
  - Target: All high-value user flows.
- **Manual QA:**
  - Used for exploratory testing, UI/UX review, and edge cases not easily automated.

## Recommended Tools & Frameworks
- **Unit/Integration:** Jest (Node/React), ts-jest, supertest (API)
- **E2E:** Playwright or Cypress
- **Coverage:** Built-in Jest coverage, Playwright/Cypress coverage tools
- **Linting/Type Checking:** See [lintingAndCodeQuality.md](./lintingAndCodeQuality.md)

## QA Workflow
- All new features and bugfixes must include appropriate tests (unit, integration, or E2E as appropriate).
- Tests must pass locally and in CI before merging any PR.
- Linting and type checks are enforced in CI (see [lintingAndCodeQuality.md](./lintingAndCodeQuality.md)).
- Test coverage is tracked and reported in CI; PRs that reduce coverage must be justified.
- Manual QA is performed before major releases or after significant UI/UX changes.
- Known issues and test gaps are tracked in [progress.md](./progress.md).
