# App-Specific Components

This directory contains **app-specific components, business logic, and context providers** for the web app.

- Use this directory for components that are tied to business logic, context, or the unique needs of this app (e.g., branding, workspace layouts, business dashboards).
- Do **not** add generic UI primitives (buttons, cards, modals, etc.) hereâ€”use `shared/src/components/` for those.

**Keep this directory focused on business logic and app context!**
